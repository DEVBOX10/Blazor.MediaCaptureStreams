# Blazor.MediaCaptureStreams
A Blazor wrapper for the [Media Capture and Streams](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/) browser API.

The API standardizes ways to request access to local multimedia devices, such as microphones or video cameras. This also includes the MediaStream API, which provides the means to control where multimedia stream data is consumed, and provides some control over and information about the devices that produce the media. This project implements a wrapper around the API for Blazor so that we can easily and safely interact with the streams of the browser.

*The api is still in progress of being developed.*
